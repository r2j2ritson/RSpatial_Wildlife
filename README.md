# An R toolbox for Spatial Wildlife Ecologists 
This repository contains tools for assisting Wildlife Ecologists with spatial analyses in R. These are primarily enhancements on functions from existing R packages.
Primary functionality provides:

- Parsing date infromation from image file paths
- Simultaneous installation and loading of R packages within a session
- Attributing polygons with spatial proportions from categorical rasters (similar to ArcGIS 'Zonal Histogram' tool)
- Calculating vector ruggedness measure (Sappington et al, 2007) from elevation raster, enhanced for R (using `terra`)
